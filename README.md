## Hellodog
As part of the Le Wagon Bootcamp, each student had to pitch an idea and work in teams to build it. I wanted to create something that would help people and animals. The most common pet in Australia are dogs so I thought I'd look into that area.

Finding dogs with complimentary personalities can be a challenge and a pain point for a number of dog owners. Dogs can be picky just like their human counterparts. Getting a dog friend might be a great idea, but it can lead to aggression and injuries, if it's not a good fit. 

I wanted to create Hellodog (mobile app) to make the socialising process a lot simpler and efficient. A community for people to socialise their beloved pets.

## Hellodog
As part of the Le Wagon Bootcamp, each student had to pitch an idea and work in teams to build it. Only four ideas can be chosen and my pitch was voted in the top 4. I was the Project Lead for Hellodog.

I wanted to create a product that would help people and animals. The most common pet in Australia are dogs so I thought I'd look into that area.  Finding dogs with complimentary personalities can be a challenge and a pain point for a number of dog owners. Dogs can be picky just like their human counterparts. 

Hellodog (mobile app) was created to make the selection process a lot simpler and efficient. It serves as a community and platform for people to chat with other owners and socialise their beloved pets.

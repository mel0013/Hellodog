## Hellodog
As part of the Le Wagon Bootcamp, we all had to pitch an app idea and to work in groups to build it. I wanted to create something that would help people and animals. The most common pet in Australia are dogs so I thought I'd look into that area.

Finding dogs that compliment their dog's personality is a challenge and a pain point for a number dog owners. I wanted to create an app that would make the process a lot simpler and efficient.

Hellodog is a ruby and rails app for dogs to socialise with other dogs.
